ðŸš€ Eventini - Event Management Platform ðŸŽ‰
I'm excited to share Eventini, a comprehensive event management platform I've been developing! This full-stack web application empowers users to create, discover, and manage events with ease.
Key Features:
âœ… Event Creation & Management - Intuitive forms for organizers to list events with custom ticket types, pricing, and capacity
âœ… User Profiles - Personalized dashboards showing created and attended events with interactive maps
âœ… Secure Authentication - Robust user registration/login system with password protection
âœ… Interactive Map - Visual event discovery using Leaflet.js with clustering for high-density areas
âœ… Responsive Design - Mobile-friendly interface with smooth animations and transitions
âœ… File Uploads - Support for event images and legal document submissions
Tech Stack:
ðŸ”¹ Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with Leaflet.js for maps)
ðŸ”¹ Backend: PHP with MySQL database
ðŸ”¹ Security: Password hashing, form validation
This project challenged me to implement complex features like:
Dynamic ticket type management
Real-time map visualization of events
File upload handling with server-side validation
Responsive design with CSS animations
I'm particularly proud of the clean UI/UX and the performance optimizations I implemented to handle multiple concurrent events and users.
